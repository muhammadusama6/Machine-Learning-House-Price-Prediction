Problem: The problem being solved is to predict the median house value of a given location based on various features of that location, 
         such as the number of rooms, bedrooms, population, households, etc.

Dataset: The dataset used is called "housing.csv" and it contains information about various locations in California, including median house value, 
         median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and ocean proximity.

Preprocessing: In the script, the first step is to remove any rows with missing values. Then, it takes the natural logarithm of certain columns 
               (total rooms, total bedrooms, population, and households) to improve the distribution of the data. Next, it creates dummy variables 
               for the "ocean_proximity" column, which is a categorical variable, and drops the original "ocean_proximity" column. These preprocessing 
               steps are done on both the training and testing data.

Model Selection and Evaluation: The script uses the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library to fit a linear regression model to the training 
                                data. The model is evaluated using the test data by finding the R-squared score, which is a measure of how well the model 
                                fits the data. A score of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit and a score of 0.0 indicates that the model does not fit the data 
                                at all.

Results and Conclusions: The final line of code in the script prints out the R-squared score of the model on the test data, which is a measure of how 
                         well the model is able to predict the median house value of a given location based on the other features of that location. 
                         Based on this score and other evaluation metric, we can conclude how well the model is performing.
                         
Model tuning was not done and the model accuracy was 0.6797. Its not too good. But it was a beginner level project.
