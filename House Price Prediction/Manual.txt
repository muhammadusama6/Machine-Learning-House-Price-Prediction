This is the manual to run the House Price Prediction Model.

1) I used Jupyter notebook to make this model. So, use code cells to run the short code lines.
2) If you try to run whole code at once in VS Code or Conda or any other environment, it might not run at once.
3) Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Don't worry, they are free online IDE.
